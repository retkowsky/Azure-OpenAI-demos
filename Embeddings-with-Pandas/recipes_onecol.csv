"Recipe: Caramelized Bread Pudding with Chocolate and Cinnamon - Ingredients: 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened;4 or 5 slices brioche, or good quality white bread (I like Pepperidge Farm), 1/4 inch thick, crusts removed;3 extra-large eggs;2 extra-large egg yolks;1/4 cup brown sugar;1 1/2 cups heavy cream;1 1/4 cups whole milk;1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract;1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon;1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg;1/4 teaspoon kosher salt;3/4 cup chopped bittersweet chocolate;1 tablespoon granulated sugar, for caramelizing the top- Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spread the softened butter on one side of the brioche. Cut each slice in half on the diagonal and then again into quarters. Whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, and brown sugar in a large bowl. Add the cream, milk, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt, whisking to combine well. Sprinkle the chocolate over the bottom of a 9-by-9-inch (or equivalent) baking dish. Arrange the brioche, buttered side up, with slices overlapping just slightly, on the chocolate (there should be just a single layer of bread). Pour the custard over the bread, pressing down with your fingers to make sure the bread soaks it up. Place the bread pudding in a roasting pan, and pour warm water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the pudding dish. Bake about 1 hour and 15 minutes, until the custard is set and the bread puffs up slightly. The pudding will be springy to the touch. Let the bread pudding cool at least 10 minutes. If you have a kitchen blowtorch, sprinkle the sugar over the top, and torch to brown and caramelize. You could run the pudding under the broiler to caramelize if you don’t have a torch, but be careful not to curdle the custard underneath. Serve the bread pudding from the baking dish at the table, using a big spoon.

"Recipe: Chocolate Roll-Out Cookies - Ingredients: 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour;1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder;1/2 teaspoon baking powder;1/2 teaspoon salt;1/4 teaspoon baking soda;1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional);3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped;1 cup (2 sticks) butter, room temperature;1 1/3 cups sugar;1 large egg;1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract;Sprinkles or other sugar decorations (optional);Royal Icing (optional)- Instructions: Sift first 5 ingredients and cinnamon, if desired, into medium bowl. Stir chocolate in metal bowl set over saucepan of simmering water until melted and smooth. Set aside. Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl at medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add sugar and beat until mixture is pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add egg; beat until well blended, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low and beat in vanilla and chocolate. Add flour mixture and beat on low speed just to blend. Gather dough into ball; divide in half. Form each half into ball and flatten into disk. Wrap disks separately in plastic and chill until firm, at least 4 hours. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before rolling out. Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 350°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Working with 1 disk at a time, roll out dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper to 1/8-inch thickness for smaller (2-inch) cookies and 1/4-inch thickness for larger (3- to 4-inch) cookies. Using waxed paper prevents you from adding too much flour, which will make the cookies tough. Using decorative cookie cutters, cut out cookies. Cold dough is much easier to work with. If it gets warm as you're cutting out the cookies, place the dough—waxed paper and all—in the freezer for about 5 minutes. Use an offset spatula to peel away the excess dough and transfer the cookies to parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart. Gather scraps, roll out dough, and cut more cookies, repeating until all dough is used. If not icing cookies, decorate with sprinkles or other sugar toppings, if desired. Bake 1 sheet at a time until cookies are firm on top and slightly darker around edges, about 9 minutes for smaller cookies and up to 12 minutes for larger cookies. Line baking sheets with fresh parchment as needed. Cool completely on rack. Decorate cookies with royal icing if desired. DO AHEAD: Cookies can be made 4 days ahead. Store between sheets of waxed paper in airtight containers.

"Recipe: Bourbon and Brown Sugar Glazed Turkey - Ingredients: 6 tablespoons kosher salt;4 tablespoons black peppercorns, medium ground;1 tablespoon granulated sugar;1 tablespoon paprika;1 (12–14-pound) turkey;1 head of garlic, cut in half crosswise;2 sprigs rosemary;Olive oil (for cooking; 5–7 cups);1/2 cup (packed) light brown sugar;1/2 cup bourbon;2 tablespoons soy sauce;2 tablespoons unsalted butter;1 teaspoon paprika- Instructions: Dry brine: Mix salt, pepper, granulated sugar, and paprika in a small bowl. Arrange turkey on a cutting board breast side up. Remove legs (keeping thigh and drumstick intact) by slicing through the skin that joins breast and leg, then bend leg down to expose joint and cut completely through the joint. Try to leave as much skin on breast as possible. Place legs on a large rimmed baking sheet. Set aside neck and giblets in cavity for making gravy. Arrange turkey on baking sheet with legs and generously sprinkle legs and turkey all over with dry brine, patting to adhere. Chill, uncovered, at least 12 hours and up to 2 days.

Confit legs: Wipe off turkey legs (do not rinse) and place in the smallest heavy pot that will accommodate legs in a single layer (it’s okay if they overlap slightly). Add garlic and rosemary. Pour in oil just to barely cover legs. Heat over medium until a few bubbles begin to appear. Cover, reduce heat, and very gently simmer until meat is tender (the meat on the drumstick will have pulled away from the bone), 3–3 1/2 hours. Let turkey thighs cool in oil until just warm, about 2 hours. Chill at least 2 hours but preferably longer. Meat will firm up the colder it gets, making it less likely to fall apart when glazing.

Breast and assembly: Preheat oven to 425°F. Place turkey on a wire rack set inside a large rimmed baking sheet. Roast, rotating baking sheet once, until golden brown all over, 35–40 minutes. Meanwhile, bring brown sugar, bourbon, soy sauce, butter, and paprika to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until reduced by about half and thick enough to coat a spoon but not syrupy, 6–8 minutes. Reduce heat to very low and keep glaze warm until ready to use. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F and roast turkey until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 100°F–110°F. Then roast, basting every 10 minutes or so, making sure to lightly coat the entire breast each time (but save some glaze for the legs) and rotating baking sheet occasionally, until thermometer registers 150°F, 60–75 minutes total after reducing oven temperature to 325°F.

Line 2 cupcake pans with 18 paper liners and fill the empty cups half full of water to prevent scorching. To make the cupcakes, mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder together in a large bowl. In a food processor, blend the canola oil, agave nectar, soy milk, tofu, vanilla extract, and vinegar, scraping down the bowl often. Blend until very smooth, with no chunks of tofu visible, about 2 to 3 minutes. Combine the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients. Stir well and spoon into the prepared cupcake pan, leaving some room at the top of each cup. Bake for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Remove the cupcakes from the pan and place on a cooling rack. Cool completely before filling and frosting. To prepare the filling, blend the tofu in a food processor until very smooth and creamy, approximately 1 to 2 minutes. Add the agave nectar and blend again. Add the peanut butter, vanilla extract, and salt and blend thoroughly until very light and smooth. Refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours to firm before filling the cupcakes. To assemble the cupcakes, you will need a pastry bag fitted with a large, plain smooth tip. Fill the pastry bag with peanut butter mousse and insert the tip halfway into the top of a cupcake. Squeeze filling inside each cupcake just until it starts to expand. Next frost the tops. If the frosting is too firm, heat in the microwave for a few seconds to soften it up. Spread the ganache evenly over the tops of the cupcakes. Let the cupcakes sit in the refrigerator until ready to serve. Garnish with peanuts if desired.

Cook's Notes Try to buy shelled hazelnuts (also called filberts) with the brown, papery skins removed as well. To toast, spread the hazelnuts in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and place in a preheated 375°F oven. Toast for about 12 minutes until lightly browned. If the nuts still have the skins on, transfer them while they're hot to a clean kitchen towel. (Use a clean towel that is old or you don't mind washing with bleach, because the skins tend to discolor the fabric.) Rub the nuts to remove most of the skins (they never come completely off). You can substitute unsalted cashews for the hazelnuts. Toast cashews, as directed above for hazelnuts, for 8 to 10 minutes until lightly browned.

Cooking notes: A great chicken dish deserves (and depends on) a great chicken—buy the highest-quality bird you can find. The best place to look is a farmers' market. The chicken never browns, so if presentation is your thing, avert your eyes—or simply pull the meat from the bones and make a warm salad with escarole, the broth, and prosciutto. Or use the meat and sauce to make a very simple pasta dish. Whatever you do, be careful not to overcook the chicken. And serve it right after cooking, when its aromatics are most intense. The original recipe said it serves 4, but when I made the dish for my mother and me, we polished off the whole thing. Only count on it serving 4 if you're making a bunch of side dishes. It may seem strange to buy expensive prosciutto and cut it into cubes, but don't skimp on the quality of prosciutto. I did once and was punished with a salty sauce. If you can only get indifferent prosciutto, add less of it.

Readers: ""I remember that I used the recipe the first time because chicken was affordable for a crowd and the ingredients then seemed different but not weird. This recipe as I read and reread it over the years pushed me to learn more about cooking. Why not brown the chicken pieces? (Giobbi does not.) What about putting it all together and sticking it in the oven? What if I chopped the seasonings and put them in the cavity and under the skin of a roasting chicken and then, well, roasted it? The recipe with its time-proven flavors (back to the Renaissance at least?) has never failed. ""For me, this is one of those recipes that permutes endlessly as the seasons, the occasion, or the cook's mood changes. Sometimes (often) I do brown the chicken, sometimes use pancetta instead of prosciutto, sometimes add a little chopped tomato, sometimes introduce porcini mushrooms. If the company at dinner have dietary restrictions, oil-cured black olives can stand in for the pork. I have tried it with boneless chicken breasts only—satisfactory—and with guinea hen—excellent.""

"Recipe: Malt Chocolate Doughnuts - Ingredients: 1/4 cup sugar, plus 2-3 heaping Tbsp for dusting;2/3 cup whole milk;One 1/4-ounce package active dry yeast;3 1/2 Tbsp unsalted butter;2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting;Pinch of sea salt;2 egg yolks;2-3 heaping Tbsp malt powder, such as Ovaltine, for dusting;Vegetable oil, for deep-frying;1 cup heavy cream;2-4 Tbsp runny honey, to taste;9 ounces dark chocolate, chopped;4 Tbsp unsalted cold butter, cubed- Instructions: 1. Heat the sugar and milk in a pan for about 5 minutes until the milk is warm—105-115°F—and the sugar has dissolved. Place the yeast into a bowl, pour in half the warm milk, then mix and set aside. Place the remaining milk back on the heat and add the butter. Heat gently for about 3 minutes (be careful not to let the milk boil). 2. Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the center. Add the egg yolks, yeasted milk, and the hot milk. Mix together, drawing in the surrounding flour to make a dough. 3. Tip the dough onto a floured work surface and knead with floured hands for a few minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Dust with a little extra flour if the mix is too sticky. Place in a clean bowl dusted with flour. Cover with plastic wrap to keep the dough from forming a skin on top and leave to rise in a warm place for 1-11/2 hours until doubled in size. 4. When the dough has risen, knock it back by giving it a thump and knead lightly on a floured work surface. Roll out the dough with a floured rolling pin to a thickness of about 3/4 inch and shape it into a 9 x 6-inch rectangle. Using a sharp knife, cut the dough into 12 rectangular pillows, then place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and leave to rise again for 30-40 minutes until doubled in size. (This will make the doughnuts light and fluffy once cooked.) 5. Meanwhile, make the filling. Put the cream in a pan and mix in the honey to taste. Put the chocolate and butter into a heatproof bowl. When the cream is almost boiling, pour it over the chocolate mixture and stir until well mixed, smooth, and glossy. 6. Combine the remaining sugar with the malt powder in a bowl and set aside. Put the oil in a deep-fat fryer and heat to 340°F, or fill a large saucepan one third full with vegetable oil and heat over medium-high heat until a cube of bread dropped in it sizzles and turns golden brown in 30 seconds. Fry the doughnuts, in batches, for 3-4 minutes until evenly golden brown and cooked through, turning them in the oil once or twice. (You will need to moderate the heat between batches according to whether the doughnuts brown too quickly or too slowly.) Using a slotted spoon, remove the doughnuts from the hot oil and roll in the malt sugar to coat. 7. To fill the doughnuts, spoon the warm chocolate filling into a piping bag fitted with a small plain nozzle. Make sure you pipe the chocolate filling while it's still warm. If it cools down too much, it will set and be difficult to work with. Insert the nozzle into the doughnut and gently squeeze in the filling. Serve right away.
1. Heat the sugar and milk in a pan for about 5 minutes until the milk is warm—105-115°F—and the sugar has dissolved. Place the yeast into a bowl, pour in half the warm milk, then mix and set aside.

Place in an oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes. 3. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions and roll into balls. Apply oil on opposite sides of the dough balls and flatten each with a rolling pin into a round disk 3 to 4 inches in diameter. 4. Line a sheet pan with paper towels. Fill a medium saucepan or heavy-bottom pan a third full with canola oil, about 4 inches, and set it over medium-high heat; heat to 350°F. Test the oil by dropping in a small piece of dough.

Heat a little vegetable oil in a small, non-stick frying pan over medium to high heat and add the egg mixture. Agitate the eggs, using a wooden spoon, so the texture of the omelette remains fluffy. When the eggs are half-cooked, fold the omelette in half, to make a semi-circle, then fold the curving section inwards to form a rectangle, and then fold the ends inwards until you have what looks like a little square package. This creates the distinctive layered effect, called tamagoyaki, characteristic of a Japanese omelette. Flip the ""package"" over and cook for a further two minutes. Cut into quarters.

"Recipe: Chicken Cordon Bleu - Supremes de Volaille Cordon Bleu - Ingredients: 2 whole boneless chicken breasts, skinned, split into halves, and trimmed;2 ounces thinly sliced uncooked country ham or prosciutto;4 ounces Gruyère cheese;Dijon mustard;1/4 cup all-purpose flour;1 large egg;1 1/2 cups dry bread crumbs;Peanut oil, for frying- Instructions: One: Wash the chicken and pat dry. Place the chicken breasts skinned side up on a sheet of waxed paper or plastic wrap. Cover them with a second sheet of paper or wrap and, with a flat (not textured) wooden mallet, lightly beat them until flattened to a uniform thinness of less than 1/4 inch. Set aside. Two: Cut the ham and cheese into thin slices 1/2 inch wide and 2 inches long. Break the egg into a shallow bowl and beat until smooth. Spread the crumbs on a second shallow bowl. Spread the flour on a dinner plate. Three: Lay the chicken pieces on a flat work surface skinned side down. Lightly spread the inside of each breast with a little mustard (don't use too much or the mustard will overpower the other flavors). Stack 2 slices of cheese and a slice of ham (2 if they are very thin) in the center of each breast. Fold over the small side of the breast, then fold each end up, like an envelope, and finally fold over the large side. Make sure that the filling is completely encased. Roll the chicken first in the flour, shake off the excess, and dip each breast in the egg, allowing the excess to flow back into the bowl. Lay it in the crumbs. Roll it carefully so that it doesn't open up (crumbs should not get inside the folds or they won't stay closed when it cooks), patting the crumbs into all sides. When the piece is coated, lay it on a clean, dry plate and repeat until all the pieces are breaded. Set aside for at least half an hour to allow the breading to set. (You may make them several hours or even a day ahead up to this point. Cover and refrigerate, but take them out at least half an hour before cooking.) Four: Fill a deep Dutch oven, or a deep-fat fryer with enough peanut oil to come halfway up the sides, at least 2 inches deep. Over medium-high heat, bring the oil to 375°F (hot but not smoking). Add the chicken and fry until golden brown, maintaining a temperature of 365°F, about 4 to 5 minutes. Five: Drain well and serve at once.

What to drink: Surprisingly, an offdry Riesling is excellent with the sweet and spicy flavors in this menu. We like the 2006 Riesling ($14) from Koehler Winery in California's Santa Ynez Valley. Its citrus and green apple flavors are a nice foil for the smoky chiles here. For a more classic pairing, go for beer: Try a hoppy, malty IPA (India Pale Ale), like Northern California's Lagunitas IPA ($9 for a six-pack).

"Recipe: Bagels - Ingredients: 1 tablespoon (0.75 oz / 21 g) barley malt syrup, honey, or rice syrup, or 1 teaspoon (0.25 oz / 7 g) diastatic malt powder;1 teaspoon (0.11 oz / 3 g) instant yeast;1 1/2 teaspoons (0.37 oz / 10.5 g) salt, or 2 1/2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt;1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (9 oz / 255 g) lukewarm water (about 95°F or 35°C);3 1/2 cups (16 oz / 454 g) unbleached bread flour;2 to 3 quarts (64 to 96 oz / 181 to 272 g) water;1 1/2 tablespoons (1 oz / 28.5 g) barley malt syrup or honey (optional);1 tablespoon (0.5 oz / 14 g) baking soda;1 teaspoon (0.25 oz / 7 g) salt, or 1 1/2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt- Instructions: Do ahead To make the dough, stir the malt syrup, yeast, and salt into the lukewarm water. Place the flour into a mixing bowl and pour in the malt syrup mixture. If using a mixer, use the dough hook and mix on the lowest speed for 3 minutes. If mixing by hand, use a large, sturdy spoon and stir for about 3 minutes, until well blended. The dough should form a stiff, coarse ball, and the flour should be fully hydrated; if it isn’t, stir in a little more water. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes. Resume mixing with the dough hook on the lowest speed for another 3 minutes or transfer to a very lightly floured work surface and knead by hand for about 3 minutes to smooth out the dough and develop the gluten. The dough should be stiff yet supple, with a satiny, barely tacky feel. If the dough seems too soft or overly tacky, mix or knead in a little more flour. Place the dough in a clean, lightly oiled bowl, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and let the dough rise at room temperature for 1 hour. When you’re ready to shape the bagels, prepare a sheet pan by lining it with parchment paper or a silicone mat, then misting it with spray oil or lightly coating it with oil. Divide the dough into 6 to 8 equal pieces. (A typical bagel is about 4 ounces or 113 grams before baking, but you can make them smaller. If you make more than 6 bagels, you may need to prepare 2 sheet pans.) Form each piece into a loose ball by rolling it on a clean, dry work surface with a cupped hand. (Don’t use any flour on the work surface. If the dough slides around and won’t ball up, wipe the surface with a damp paper towel and try again; the slight bit of moisture will provide enough traction for the dough to form into a ball.) There are two methods to shape the balls into bagels. The first method is to poke a hole through the center of the ball to create a donut shape. Holding the dough with both thumbs in the hole, rotate the dough with your hands, gradually stretching it to create a hole about 2 inches in diameter. The second method, preferred by professional bagel makers, is to use both hands (and a fair amount of pressure) to roll the ball into a rope about 8 inches long on a clean, dry work surface. (Again, wipe the surface with a damp towel, if necessary, to create sufficient friction on the work surface.) Taper the rope slightly at each end and moisten the last inch or so of the ends. Place one end of the dough in the palm of your hand and wrap the rope around your hand to complete the circle, going between your thumb and forefinger and then all the way around. The ends should overlap by about 2 inches. Squeeze the overlapping ends together by closing your hand, then press the seam into the work surface, rolling it back and forth a few times to seal. Remove the dough from your hand, squeezing it to even out the thickness if need be and creating a hole of about 2 inches in diameter. Place each shaped bagel on the prepared sheet pan, then mist with spray oil or brush with a light coating of oil. Cover the entire pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or for up to 2 days. (You can also proof the full piece of dough in the oiled bowl overnight and then shape the bagels on baking day, 60 to 90 minutes before boiling and baking them, or as soon as they pass the float test.)

(You can also proof the full piece of dough in the oiled bowl overnight and then shape the bagels on baking day, 60 to 90 minutes before boiling and baking them, or as soon as they pass the float test.)
On baking day Remove the bagels from the refrigerator 60 to 90 minutes before you plan to bake them, and if you plan to top them with dried onion or garlic, rehydrate those ingredients (see the variations). Immediately check whether the bagels are ready for baking using the “float test”: Place one of the bagels in a small bowl of cold water. If it sinks and doesn’t float back to the surface, shake it off, return it to the pan, and wait for another 15 to 20 minutes, then test it again. When one bagel passes the float test, they’re all ready to be boiled. If they pass the float test before you are ready to boil and bake them, return them to the refrigerator so they don’t overproof. About 30 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C) and gather and prepare your garnishes (seeds, onions, garlic, and so on). To make the poaching liquid, fill a pot with 2 to 3 quarts (64 to 96 oz / 181 to 272 g) of water, making sure the water is at least 4 inches deep. Cover, bring to a boil, then lower the heat to maintain at a simmer. Stir in the malt syrup, baking soda, and salt. Gently lower each bagel into the simmering poaching liquid, adding as many as will comfortably fit in the pot. They should all float to the surface within 15 seconds. After 1 minute, use a slotted spoon to turn each bagel over. Poach for another 30 to 60 seconds, then use the slotted spoon to transfer it back to the pan, domed side up. (It’s important that the parchment paper be lightly oiled, or the paper will glue itself to the dough as the bagels bake.) Sprinkle on a generous amount of whatever toppings you like as soon as the bagels come out of the water (except cinnamon sugar; see the variation for details). Transfer the pan of bagels to the oven, then lower the oven heat to 450°F (232°C). Bake for 8 minutes, then rotate the pan and check the underside of the bagels. If they’re getting too dark, place another pan under the baking sheet. (Doubling the pan will insulate the first baking sheet.) Bake for another 8 to 12 minutes, until the bagels are a golden brown. Cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing or serving.

Bake for 8 minutes, then rotate the pan and check the underside of the bagels. If they’re getting too dark, place another pan under the baking sheet. (Doubling the pan will insulate the first baking sheet.) Bake for another 8 to 12 minutes, until the bagels are a golden brown.
Cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing or serving.
Variations You can replace any amount of the bread flour with an equal amount of whole grain flour (by weight), such as wheat or rye. If you do so, increase the water in the dough by 1 tablespoon (0.5 oz / 14 g) for every 2 ounces (56.5 g) of whole grain flour you substitute. Top your bagels with any combination of the following garnishes: poppy seeds, sesame seeds, coarse salt, or rehydrated dried onions or garlic. (Soak dried onions or garlic in water to cover for at least 1 hour before applying.) The toppings will stick even better if you first brush the top of each bagel with an egg white wash made by whisking 1 egg white with 1 tablespoon (0.5 oz / 14 g) of water. If using coarse salt as a garnish, remember that a little goes a long way. For raisin bagels, mix in 1 1/3 cups (8 oz / 227 g) of raisins during the final 2 minutes of mixing and, if you like cinnamon, stir 1/2 teaspoon (0.14 oz / 4 g) of ground cinnamon into the flour before you start mixing. When the bagels come out of the oven, brush the tops with melted butter and dip the top into a bed of cinnamon sugar to give it a very tasty cinnamon crust. You can make cinnamon sugar by whisking 2 tablespoons (1.6 oz / 44 g) of ground cinnamon into 1/2 cup (4 oz / 113 g) of granulated sugar.

2. Make the flour mixture and add to the sponge. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour (reserve 1/4 cup if mixing by hand), dry milk, and instant yeast. Sprinkle this on top of the sponge and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Allow it to ferment for 1 to 4 hours at room temperature. (During this time, the sponge will bubble through the flour blanket in places: this is fine.)

3. Mix the dough. Mixer Method Add the butter to the bowl and mix with the dough hook on low speed (#2 if using a KitchenAid) for 1 minute or until the flour is moistened enough to form a rough dough. Scrape down any bits of dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rest for 20 minutes. Sprinkle on the salt and knead the dough on medium speed (#4 KitchenAid) for 7 to 10 minutes. It will not come away from the bowl until the last minute or so of kneading; it will be smooth and shiny and stick to your fingers. With an oiled spatula, scrape down any dough clinging to the sides of the bowl. If the dough is not stiff, knead in a little flour. If it is not at all sticky, spray it with a little water and knead it in. (The dough will weigh about 44.25 ounces/1258 grams.)

Hand Method Add the salt and butter to the bowl and, with a wooden spoon or your hand, stir until all the flour is moistened. Knead the dough in the bowl until it comes together, then scrape it onto a lightly floured counter. Knead the dough for 5 minutes, enough to develop the gluten structure a little, adding as little of the reserved flour as possible to keep the dough from sticking. Use a bench scraper to scrape the dough and gather it together as you knead it. At this point, it will be very sticky. Cover it with the inverted bowl and allow it to rest for 20 minutes. (This resting time will make the dough less sticky and easier to work with.) Knead the dough for another 5 minutes or until it is very smooth and elastic. It should still be tacky (sticky) enough to cling slightly to your fingers a little. If the dough is still very sticky, however, add some of the remaining reserved flour, or a little extra.

Both Methods 4. Let the dough rise. Using an oiled spatula or dough scraper, scrape the dough into a 4-quart dough-rising container or bowl, lightly oiled with cooking spray or oil. Push down the dough and lightly spray or oil the surface. Cover the container with a lid or plastic wrap. With a piece of tape, mark the side of the container at approximately where double the height of the dough would be. Allow the dough to rise (ideally at 75°to 80°F) until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Using an oiled spatula or dough scraper, scrape the dough onto a floured counter and press down on it gently to form a rectangle. It will be full of air and resilient. Try to maintain as many of the air bubbles as possible. Pull out and fold the dough over from all four sides into a tight package, or give it 2 business letter turns and set it back in the container. Again oil the surface, cover, and mark where double the height would now be. (It will fill the container fuller than before because it is puffier with air.) Allow the dough to rise for 1 to 2 hours or until it reaches the mark.

Allow the dough to rise for 1 to 2 hours or until it reaches the mark.
5. Shape the dough and let it rise. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and cut it in half. Shape each piece into a loaf: begin by gently pressing the dough (or lightly rolling it with a rolling pin) into a wide rectangle; the exact size is not important at this point. (A long side of the dough should be facing toward you.) Dimple the dough with your fingertips to deflate any large bubbles. Fold over the right side of the dough to a little past the center. Fold over the left side of the dough to overlap it slightly. Press the center overlap section with the side of your hand to seal the dough. (If you have a lot of experience shaping, you may prefer at this point to rotate the dough 90 degrees-a quarter turn.) Starting at the top edge of the dough, roll it over three or four times, until it reaches the bottom edge of the dough: with each roll, press with your thumbs to seal it and at the same time push it away from you slightly to tighten the outer skin. As you roll and press, the dough will become wider. If it is not as long as the pan, place both hands close together on top of the dough and, rolling back and forth, gradually work your way toward the ends, gently stretching the dough. For the most even shape, it is important to keep a tight skin on the surface of the dough and not to tear it. If you want the edges of the loaf to be smooth, tuck the sides under. Place the loaves in the prepared loaf pans; the dough will be about 1/2 inch from the top of the pans. Cover them with a large container, or cover them loosely with oiled plastic wrap, and allow to rise until the center is about 1 inch above the sides of the pan, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. When the dough is pressed with a fingertip, the depression will very slowly fill in.
5. Shape the dough and let it rise. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and cut it in half. Shape each piece into a loaf: begin by gently pressing the dough (or lightly rolling it with a rolling pin) into a wide rectangle; the exact size is not important at this point. (A long side of the dough should be facing toward you.) Dimple the dough with your fingertips to deflate any large bubbles. Fold over the right side of the dough to a little past the center. Fold over the left side of the dough to overlap it slightly. Press the center overlap section with the side of your hand to seal the dough. (If you have a lot of experience shaping, you may prefer at this point to rotate the dough 90 degrees-a quarter turn.) Starting at the top edge of the dough, roll it over three or four times, until it reaches the bottom edge of the dough: with each roll, press with your thumbs to seal it and at the same time push it away from you slightly to tighten the outer skin. As you roll and press, the dough will become wider. If it is not as long as the pan, place both hands close together on top of the dough and, rolling back and forth, gradually work your way toward the ends, gently stretching the dough.

7. Bake the bread. Quickly but gently set the pans on the hot baking stone or hot baking sheet. Toss 1/2 cup of ice cubes into the pan beneath and immediately shut the door. Bake for 50 minutes or until medium golden brown and a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read about 210°F). Halfway through baking, turn the pans around for even baking.

POINTERS FOR SUCCESS • If not using the dry milk, you can replace 1 cup of the water with 1 cup milk, preferably nonfat, scalded (brought to the boiling point) and cooled to lukewarm.

UNDERSTANDING A greater amount of sponge dough starter (pre-ferment) offers a fuller flavor in this ""plain"" bread, so almost 50 percent of total amount of flour is used in the sponge, compared to the usual 30 percent of hearth breads. If using liquid milk, it is scalded to deactivate the enzyme in it that could make the dough sticky. Baking the bread at too high a temperature, would result in too thin a crust, which would cause keyholing, or caving in at the sides of the loaf. Therefore, this bread is baked at 350°F. It is also important for the bread to be thoroughly baked so that the crust is firm enough to prevent it from compressing. The loaves should not be cut until completely cool for the same reason.

"Recipe: Couscous and Mograbiah with Oven-Dried Tomatoes - Ingredients: 16 large, ripe plum tomatoes, cut in half lengthwise;2 tbsp muscovado sugar;2/3 cup / 150 ml olive oil;2 tbsp balsamic vinegar;2 onions, thinly sliced;1 1/2 cups / 250 g mograbiah;1 2/3 cups / 400 ml chicken or vegetable stock;A pinch of saffron threads;1 1/2 cups / 250 g couscous;1 tbsp tarragon leaves;1 tbsp nigella seeds;3 1/2 ounces / 100 g Labneh;coarse sea salt and freshly ground black pepper- Instructions: 1. Preheat the oven to 300°F / 150°C. Arrange the tomato halves, skin side down, on a baking sheet and sprinkle with the sugar, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, the balsamic vinegar, and some salt and pepper. Place in the oven and bake for 2 hours, until the tomatoes have lost most of their moisture. 2. Meanwhile, put the onions in a large pan with 4 tablespoons of the olive oil and sauté over high heat for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are a dark golden color. 3. Throw the mograbiah into a large pan of boiling salted water (as for cooking pasta). Simmer for 15 minutes, until it is soft but still retains a bite; some varieties might take less time, so check the instructions on the packet. Drain well and rinse under cold water. 4. In a separate pot, bring the stock to a boil with the saffron and a little salt. Place the couscous in a large bowl and add 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and the boiling stock. Cover with plastic wrap and leave for 10 minutes. 5. Once ready, mix the couscous with a fork or a whisk to get rid of any lumps and to fluff it up. Add the cooked mograbiah, the tomatoes and their juices, the onions and their oil, the tarragon, and half the nigella seeds. Taste and adjust the seasoning and oil. It is likely that it will need a fair amount of salt. Allow the dish to come to room temperature. To serve, arrange it gently on a serving plate, place the labneh on top (in balls or spoonfuls), drizzle with remaining oil, and finish with the rest of the nigella seeds.

Mix garlic, butter, and herbs in a small bowl. Transfer to a resealable container (small jars work well). Seal and store until ready to use.
Cook the steak: Find 2 of the flattest rocks you can; they should be large enough to fit steaks and at least as thick (about 2"" thick is perfect). Place rocks in the center of a fire pit and build a campfire on and around them. Let fire burn until hot coals have covered the rocks (you can help this along by pushing coals on and around them), about 30 minutes. Using tongs or heatproof gloves, move rocks away from flames and place them on top of a bed of hot coals. Sprinkle a few drops of water on the rocks—the rocks are ready when the water sizzles and skips across their surface. Brush steaks with oil and season generously with salt and pepper (really make it rain). Brush any coals or ash from surface of rocks and place 1 steak on top of each. Cook steak until it easily releases from rocks, 6–12 minutes per side for medium-rare, depending on how hot the rocks are. Check for doneness by touch, using an instant-read thermometer (125°F for medium rare), or by cutting into steak to see the internal color. Transfer steak to a plate or cutting board and place a nob of Wild Herb Butter on top. Let rest for 5 minutes. Cut steak into thick slices and divide among plates, dotting slices with more butter.

Let fire burn until hot coals have covered the rocks (you can help this along by pushing coals on and around them), about 30 minutes.
Using tongs or heatproof gloves, move rocks away from flames and place them on top of a bed of hot coals. Sprinkle a few drops of water on the rocks—the rocks are ready when the water sizzles and skips across their surface.
Brush steaks with oil and season generously with salt and pepper (really make it rain). Brush any coals or ash from surface of rocks and place 1 steak on top of each. Cook steak until it easily releases from rocks, 6–12 minutes per side for medium-rare, depending on how hot the rocks are. Check for doneness by touch, using an instant-read thermometer (125°F for medium rare), or by cutting into steak to see the internal color.
Transfer steak to a plate or cutting board and place a nob of Wild Herb Butter on top. Let rest for 5 minutes. Cut steak into thick slices and divide among plates, dotting slices with more butter.
Do Ahead Butter can be made and chilled for up to 5 days, or stored at room temperature for up to 2 days.

"Recipe: Neapolitan-Style Pizza (Pizza alla Napoletana) - Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups warm water, about 70°F;1 (1/4-ounce) envelope active dry yeast;1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing as needed;4 1/2 cups all-purpose or ""00"" flour, plus more as needed;1 teaspoon kosher salt;1 pound fresh buffalo mozzarella, sliced;1 (15-ounce) can crushed San Marzano tomatoes;10 to 12 fresh basil leaves, torn;1 teaspoon dried Sicilian oregano, crumbled;Freshly ground black pepper (optional)- Instructions: 1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the hook attachment (or in a small bowl with a spoon), combine the warm water, yeast, and oil. With the mixer on low, stir the mixture to dissolve the yeast. Add the flour and salt, and continue to stir on low just until the ingredients are combined, then increase the mixer speed to medium and knead the dough until it's smooth and elastic, 5 to 6 minutes. (Alternatively, turn the flour and salt onto a work surface and create a well in the center. Pour the liquid mixture into the middle of the well and use your fingertips to drag the flour into the wet ingredients, then mix them until a soft, ragged dough forms. Gather the dough into a ball and knead until soft but elastic, about 10 minutes. Dust the dough, your hands, and the work surface with additional flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking, but use as little flour as possible.) 2. Gather the dough into a ball and transfer it to a clean bowl that's large enough to hold the dough after it doubles in volume. Dust the surface of the dough with flour, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let the dough rise at room temperature until it doubles in volume, about 1 hour. 3. While the dough is rising, drain the sliced mozzarella on several paper towels to remove any excess moisture. 4. Position an oven rack in the bottom third of the oven, placing a pizza stone on the rack if available. If a pizza stone is unavailable, brush a pizza pan lightly with olive oil. Preheat the oven to 450°F. 5. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface. Gently press it into a rough square then pull the four corners in toward the center and flip the dough over so the upper surface is smooth. Drape the ball of dough with the plastic you used during the first rise, and let it rest until it's relaxed, about 30 minutes. 6. Uncover the dough then spread and stretch it into a circle about the same dimensions as your stone or prepared pan. Carefully lift and transfer the dough to a pizza peel (if using a stone) or the pan and stretch it out into an even layer. Spread the crushed tomatoes over the pizza in an even layer and top with the mozzarella slices. 7. If using a pizza stone, use the peel to slide the pizza onto the oven rack positioned in the lower third of the oven; if using a pizza pan, simply place the pan directly on the rack. Bake the pizza until the edges are golden and the cheese is bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with the torn basil and oregano, and season with salt and pepper if desired. Cut into wedges and serve.

"Recipe: Carrot, Avocado, and Orange Salad - Ingredients: 4 medium garlic cloves, smashed and peeled;Maldon or another flaky sea salt;1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds, toasted and ground;1 1/2 teaspoons coriander seeds, toasted and ground;1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons crumbled dried pequin chilies or red pepper flakes;1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil;30 or so similarly sized (each about the size of your pointer finger) young carrots, not peeled, 1/2 inch of the green tops left on;3 tennis-ball-sized oranges;3 ripe Hass avocados, chilled;2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice;A handful of small, delicate cilantro sprigs- Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Pound the garlic with a healthy pinch of salt in a mortar until you have a wet, fairly smooth paste. (You can also do this on a cutting board, chopping and mashing and chopping and mashing until you're satisfied.) Put the paste in a large mixing bowl. Add the cumin, coriander, chilies, and 1/4 cup of the olive oil and stir well, then add the carrots and toss well so they're coated with the oil and spices. Sprinkle on 3 healthy pinches of salt, crushing the grains with your fingers as you add them, and toss again. Put the carrots in a large shallow baking dish in one layer. Scrape out the extra garlic, spices, and oil from the bowl and spread evenly on top of the carrots. Pour 1/4 cup water into an empty spot in the casserole (you don't want to wash off the tasty oily stuff) and tilt the dish so the water spreads across the bottom. Cover the dish tightly with foil and put it in the oven. Cook the carrots for 25 minutes. Take off the foil and keep cooking until the carrots are lightly browned, and about as tender and creamy as avocado flesh, but not so soft that they threaten to fall apart, about 35 minutes more. While the carrots are roasting, segment the orange as you would a lemon. Squeeze the membranes into a small bowl to release the juice. Set it aside. When the carrots are done, take the dish out of the oven and let it sit until the carrots have cooled a bit but are still warm. Meanwhile, take the avocados from the fridge. Halve them lengthwise, remove the pits, and peel the halves. Cut the flesh lengthwise into slices about the same size as the carrots—the slices should be sturdy enough that they don't break up when you toss them. Put the avocado slices in a large mixing bowl and add the reserved orange juice, the lemon juice, the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, and a healthy pinch or two of salt. Toss gently and well with your hands. Push the avocado to one side of the bowl. Add the carrots a handful at a time, scraping and tossing them in the beautiful green liquid in the bowl before adding the next handful. Make sure to scrape out and add all the garlicky spices left in the baking dish. Toss it all together gently, being careful not to break the avocado slices. Stack the carrots, avocado, and orange segments on a platter or in a serving bowl so they're facing this way and that. Top with the cilantro and serve right away.

"Recipe: Corn-Pancetta Puddings in Corn Husk Baskets - Ingredients: 2 ears of corn;3/4 cup heavy cream;3/4 cup milk;3 ounces pancetta, diced small;4 large eggs;1/4 cup unsalted butter or a mixture of butter and rendered pancetta fat, melted and cooled;1/2 cup all-purpose flour;1/2 cup polenta or cornmeal;1 tablespoon sugar;1 teaspoon baking powder;3/4 teaspoon kosher salt;Pinch of freshly ground pepper;Pinch of cayenne;1/2 cup seeded and diced tomatoes- Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 12-cup muffin tin plus 6 cups of an additional tin. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Trim the leafy tops of the husks from each ear of corn and slice through the bottom of the cob to more easily remove the husks. Discarding the tougher outer husks, trim off any extra curved part of the more tender inner husks, and tear the husks in half lengthwise until you have 36 strips about the width of your muffin tins. Blanch in the water until softened, 5 minutes. Drain and let cool. Holding the cobs upright on a cutting board, cut the kernels off the cobs, then measure out 1 cup; reserve any extra kernels for another use. Place the cream and milk in a small saucepan, and use the back of a knife to scrape any remaining corn and juices from the cobs into the pan. Place the cobs in the pan (break them in half to fit), bring to a simmer, and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Allow to cool in the pan. Place the pancetta in a small sauté pan over medium heat and brown until crisp, about 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels (save the remaining fat to replace of some of the butter, if you like). Before mixing the batter, press a strip of corn husk into a muffin tin, and top with a thinner strip to make a cross pattern with the ends sticking up. Repeat to use the remaining husks (if the husks pop out of place, just poke them down again) until you have lined 18 cups. Remove the cobs from the cooled cream mixture and place the mixture in a large bowl with the eggs, butter, flour, polenta, sugar, baking powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne. Fold in the 1 cup corn kernels, tomatoes, and half of the pancetta, then pour into the prepared baskets. Top with the remaining pancetta and bake until firm, about 20 minutes. Use a narrow silicone spatula or dinner knife to remove the puddings from the pan and serve immediately, or slightly warm.

If using broth right away, let stand until fat rises to top, 1 to 2 minutes, then skim off and discard fat. If not using broth right away, cool, uncovered, then chill, covered, before skimming fat (it will be easier to remove when cool or cold).
Heat oil in cleaned and dried pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook onions, carrots, and celery, stirring occasionally, until onions are golden, 10 to 12 minutes.
Add broth and simmer, uncovered, until vegetables are just tender, about 10 minutes. Add noodles, peas, and turkey and simmer, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender, about 10 minutes."

"Recipe: Rosemary Olive Oil Bread - Ingredients: 3 cups all-purpose or bread flour, plus more as needed;2 teaspoons instant yeast;2 teaspoons coarse kosher or sea salt;1/3 cup olive oil;1 tablespoon fresh rosemary leaves- Instructions: Combine the flour, yeast, and salt in a food processor. Turn on the machine and add the olive oil through the feed tube, followed by 3/4 cup water. Process for about 30 seconds, adding more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the mixture forms a ball and is slightly sticky to the touch. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and, by hand, knead in the rosemary until the dough feels smooth. Put it in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise until the dough doubles in size, about 2 hours. (You can cut this rising time as short as 1 hour if you are in a hurry, or you can let the dough rise more slowly, in the refrigerator, for up to 8 hours. At this point, you may also wrap the dough tightly in plastic and freeze for up to a month; defrost in a covered bowl in the refrigerator or at room temperature.) Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Shape the dough into a boule, sprinkling with flour as necessary but keeping it to a minimum. Line a colander or large bowl with a well-floured kitchen towel, set the loaf in the bowl, and cover with another towel (this keeps it from spreading too much). Let the dough rise for at least an hour and preferably longer, up to 2 hours. About 45 minutes before the dough has risen, heat the oven to 425°F. Put an ovenproof skillet (preferably cast iron) on the floor or the lowest rack while the oven heats. If you’re using a baking stone, put it on the rack above the skillet while the oven heats; if not, line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Once you’re ready to bake, slide or turn the dough out onto a lightly floured peel or flexible cutting board, seam side down, or just transfer it to the prepared baking sheet. Rub the loaf with a little flour (this helps prevent scorching) and slash the top with a sharp knife or razor blade. Use the peel or cutting board to slide the loaf onto the baking stone or slide the baking sheet into the oven. Partially pull out the rack with the heated skillet and very carefully pour 1 cup hot water into the skillet (it will create a lot of steam). Slide the rack back in and immediately close the oven door Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, turning the bread or the baking sheet halfway through, until the crust is golden brown, the bottom sounds hollow when tapped, and the internal temperature reaches 200°F on a quick-read thermometer. If the bread is browning too quickly, lower the temperature to 400°F. Remove and cool on a wire rack.

Variations: Rosemary Olive Oil Bread With Olives or Tomatoes: In Step 2, knead 1 cup halved pitted oil-cured olives, roughly chopped dried tomatoes, or a combination into the dough along with the rosemary. Olive Oil Bread With Onions and Mint: A nice combo; you can make this with olives too (see the preceding variation), but omit the rosemary. In Step 2, knead 1 large onion, chopped, into the dough in place of or along with the olives. Add 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint if you like. Pancetta and Black Pepper Bread: Rich, savory, and packed with flavor: You can use olive oil here if you’d rather not use the pancetta pan drippings: Omit the rosemary. Chop 1 pound pancetta (or bacon) and cook until it’s crisp. Drain the meat and set it aside, reserving 1/3 cup of the rendered fat. If you don’t have enough, add olive oil or good-quality lard to make up the balance. Proceed with the recipe, using the reserved fat in place of the oil. In Step 2, knead in the pancetta pieces and 2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper.

"Recipe: Gardener's Pizza - Ingredients: Generous pinch of sugar;1 1/4 cups/300 ml warm water {about 110°F/45°C};One 1/4-oz/7-g package active dry yeast;2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling;2 cups/255 g bread/strong flour;1 to 1 1/4 cups/175 to 200 g whole-wheat/wholemeal or white whole-wheat/wholemeal flour;1 tsp fine sea salt;Cornmeal or semolina flour;4 to 6 oz/115 to 170 g cheese, such as shredded or fresh mozzarella, burrata, or fresh ricotta;2 garlic cloves, very thinly sliced;2 to 4 handfuls fresh veggies such as sliced tomatoes, arugula/rocket, sorrel, shaved zucchini/courgette, kale, Swiss chard, corn, or mushrooms;Handful of fresh herbs, such as basil, opal basil;Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese;Extra-virgin olive oil;Fine sea salt;Freshly ground black pepper- Instructions: Make the dough: Whisk a pinch of sugar into the warm water in a small bowl and sprinkle the yeast over the top {yeast feeds on sugar so this helps to wake it up and get it going}. Stir 3 cups/385 g of the flours and salt together in a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer to combine {reserving 1/4 cup/30 g flour for later}. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture. Stir with a fork or the dough hook to make a shaggy dough. If making the dough by hand, stir vigorously with a wooden spoon to work the gluten for about 5 minutes until the dough is smooth. Then turn onto a lightly floured countertop and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes, adding small sprinkles of flour as needed to just keep it from sticking. If you're using a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, beat on high speed until the dough comes together and slaps the side of the bowl, about 5 minutes, adding up to 1/4 cup/30 grams more flour as needed to create a cohesive ball. Divide the dough half {for large pizzas} or quarters {for small pizzas} and form into balls. Place each ball of dough in a lightly oiled plastic bag, seal, and refrigerate overnight {it gets more supple as it sits overnight} or up to 3 days {or freeze for up to 1 week}. Remove the dough from the fridge 2 hours before you plan to cook. Oil two or four bowls {depending on whether you are making two large or four individual pizzas}. Turn each dough ball in the bowl to coat in oil; cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap/cling film. Draw a circle around the top to mark where the dough is now, so you can watch it expand. Set aside in a warm place until doubled, about 2 hours. Position a pizza stone on the bottom rack of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475°F/240°C/gas 9 at least 45 minutes before you plan to bake the pizzas. Lightly dust a clean countertop and the dough with flour. Press and pat each ball of dough into a rectangle or round. Once you have the basic shape you want, stretch the dough by draping it over the back of your hands and wrists, letting it hang down so gravity does the work. For larger pizzas, aim for a 7-by-12-inch/17-by 30.5-cm rectangle or a 12-inch/30.5-cm round; for individual pizzas, aim for a 6-to-9-inch/15-to-23-cm round or rectangle for smaller pizzas and flatbreads, depending on how thick you like your dough. {Don't worry if it's misshapen.} Cover the dough with a towel until baking. Generously dust a pizza peel or baking sheet/tray with cornmeal and lay on the dough, shaking the peel or sheet/tray back and forth a little to make sure the dough slides easily. Chop or slice all the vegetables into small pieces that will cook quickly in the hot oven. Top the pizzas with any topping that needs to be cooked or melted, like cheese, sliced garlic, mushrooms, and small pieces of vegetables that need cooked through{the key is to use a light hand here, since overtopped pizzas tend to turn soggy}, dividing the toppings between all the dough. Slide the pizza onto the stone {or cook directly on the baking sheet} and bake larger pizzas one at a time, smaller ones two at a time, until puffed, crisp and evenly baked through, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove and top with fresh and raw ingredients like shaved corn, sliced tomatoes, fresh basil, arugula/rocket, or sorrel. Shave or grate fresh Parmigiano-Reggiano over the top, drizzle with your best olive oil, and season with salt and black pepper.

Chef's notes: You could make the parsley mixture in a food processor, but I don't. I find hand chopping gives me the somewhat drier texture I prefer. For this recipe, I don't salt or oil the eggplant; I grill it dry. This way, it has a nice chewy texture. I marinate the eggplant as soon as it comes off the grill so the flavor of the marinade penetrates.

Preparing the Pork Trim the skin from the inner part of the leg only. Wipe the meat clean with a damp cloth. Make several deep incisions all over the skinned portion and rub with the salt. Let rest for a few minutes. Rub the marinade all over the pork, pushing it into the gashes and between the meat and the skin. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours or a maximum of 12 hours. Wipe the marinade from the skin with a clean cloth.

Roasting the Pork Preheat the oven to 400°F. Place the pork in a roasting pan and bake uncovered, skin side up, for 3 to 4 hours. Check the roast often. As the pan juices evaporate, replenish them with a little of the diluted sweet orange juice. The pork is done when the skin is crackling and the juices run clear when the meat is pierced at the thickest part of the leg (about 160°F on a meat thermometer).

Finishing the Dish Remove the pork from the oven and lift it onto a cutting board, holding the bone with a cloth. With a sharp knife, remove the crisp skin and cut it into small serving pieces. Place them on a cookie sheet and set in the turned-off oven, uncovered (if you cover the crackling, it steams and gets soggy). To deglaze the pan juices, place the roasting pan on the stove over medium heat and add the sherry, scraping up the browned bits with a wooden spoon. Carve the pork and return to the roasting pan with the pan juices to keep the meat moist and flavorful. Pork dries out easily, so if you must hold it for more than 30 minutes, cover the pan with aluminum foil and return it to a warm oven.

Whisk together honey, egg, and vanilla, then add to flour mixture and pulse just until dough comes together. (Dough will be soft.)
Transfer dough to 1 sheet of trimmed parchment (not in pan) and cover with second sheet. Roll over with a rolling pin to spread dough evenly between sheets into a roughly 15- by 11-inch rectangle. Transfer dough in parchment to pan and remove top sheet. Using wet offset spatula, spread dough into corners of pan to cover parchment completely. Holding a paring knife sideways, drag tip over dough at roughly 1/2-inch intervals to create lines resembling those on tree bark. Sprinkle dough evenly with turbinado sugar. Bake in upper third of oven until set and dry to the touch, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack 5 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F. Run a knife around edge of pan, then invert bark onto a work surface. Discard parchment. Fold bark in half lengthwise so that it breaks with uneven edges. Repeat with each piece. Tear each strip crosswise into 6 pieces. Divide biscuits, sugar sides up, between 2 baking sheets (biscuits may touch). Bake, switching position of pans halfway through baking, until deep golden brown, 15 to 25 minutes. (Biscuits will crisp completely as they cool.) Transfer to racks to cool.

For Mushroom Stroganoff variation: Clean, stem, and slice 1 to 1 1/2 pounds mushrooms. I like to combine a couple of medium-size portobello caps, thinly sliced, with some baby bellas (also known as cremini). A small amount of shiitake mushrooms added to the mix is nice, too. Start by sautéing a finely chopped medium onion in a tablespoon of olive oil or vegetable broth in a medium skillet (or in enough water or broth to keep the skillet moist) until golden. Add the mushrooms and cover. Cook until they’ve wilted down to your liking, about 5 to 8 minutes. If there’s plenty of liquid in the pan from the mushrooms, rather than drain it, thicken it with a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch dissolved in water or vegetable broth. To serve, ladle some of the mushroom mixture on top of individual servings of the pasta. Top with plenty of minced parsley and, for added plant power, some steamed fresh or frozen green peas.
