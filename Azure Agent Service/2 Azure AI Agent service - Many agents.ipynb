The **Palacio de Bellas Artes** (Palace of Fine Arts) in **Mexico City** is one of the most iconic cultural landmarks in Mexico.

Highlights include:\\n  - **\"Man at the Crossroads\"** by Diego Rivera, retrieved and adapted after it was destroyed at Rockefeller Center in New York.\\n  - Works by **David Alfaro Siqueiros**, such as *New Democracy*.\\n\\n### **Performing Arts**\\n- It is the primary venue for the **National Symphony Orchestra of Mexico**, the **National Opera Company**, and the **National Dance Company**.\\n- The Ballet Folklórico de México frequently performs there, showcasing traditional Mexican dance and music.\\n\\n### **Tourist Attraction**\\nThe Palacio de Bellas Artes is a UNESCO World Heritage Site (as part of the historic center of Mexico City) and a must-visit destination for travelers.
